There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.</p>

      <p><span class="input">count</span>: Specifies the number of records to retrieve. Must be less than or equal to 200.</p>

The output format of retweeted tweets is identical to the representation you see in home_timeline. Note: If you're using the trim_user parameter in conjunction with include_rts, the retweets will still contain a full user object.</p>
